Current Feedback Mechanisms
1. Real-Time Performance Feedback (via Groq for speed)
Key Improvements in the Enhanced Feedback System
1. Biological Neuromodulator System

Dopamine: Reward prediction error signals (like biological dopamine)
Norepinephrine: Attention and arousal modulation
Serotonin: Mood/confidence affecting learning rate
Acetylcholine: Plasticity and learning rate control
GABA: Stability and inhibition balance

2. Multi-Modal Feedback Integration
3. 3. Adaptive Feedback Effectiveness
The system now tracks which types of feedback lead to better outcomes and adapts the weighting accordingly.
4. Error Correction Mechanisms

Forward model correction: Cerebellar-like predictive error correction
Inverse model correction: Motor control adjustments
Attention-based correction: Focus on problematic areas

Missing Elements That Could Be Added:

Sleep-like Consolidation: Periodic "sleep" phases where the LLM reviews and consolidates important experiences
Social Learning: Multiple BioCog-Net instances learning from each other with LLM mediation
Emotional Memory: Stronger encoding of emotionally significant events based on LLM assessment
Predictive Coding: LLM generates predictions that the brain tries to match
Meta-learning: LLM teaches the brain how to learn more efficiently over time

The enhanced system transforms the LLM from a simple "advisor" into a sophisticated neuromodulatory control system that works more like a biological teacher - adjusting the brain's chemistry and attention to optimize learning in real-time.
